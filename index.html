<h2> History of the Dominican Republic<h2>
<p> The Dominican Republic is a Caribbean nation that shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti to the west. It's known for its beaches, resorts and golfing. Its terrain comprises rainforest, savannah and highlands.Punta Cana, on the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic, is one of the most popular tourist areas on the island. Packed with resorts, this large town is known for its beautiful beaches </p>
<p>The Dominican Republic was explored by Columbus on his first voyage in 1492. He named it La Espa√±ola,and the captial of the Dominican Rebulic was titled Santo Domingo in which for the time Spain ruled over the colony. During the time period of 1801 under the Haitian revolution which was inspired by the infamous French revolution independence leader Toussaint L'Ouverture conquered the Dominican Rebulic and the haitians settled into the colony in 1814 and by 1822 the haitians gained control of the DR.In 1844 the Haitians were thrown out and the Dominican Republic was established thus creating their own civilization as february 27, 1844 is celebrated as their independence day </p>

<h2> Culture</h2>
<p>The Dominican Republic has a multicultural past that is today reflected by strong European, African, and native Taino Indian influences.This has made the social identity of Dominicans today, showing up in their food, music, art, sports, and religion. The current population is divided in the following ethnic groups: European 16%, African origin 11%, mixed 73%. The culture is so respectful and has developed through time, the people take pride in their culture and often hold onto the traditional values to preserve their history.</p>

<h2> Language<h2>
<p> The offical language of the Dominican Republic is Spanish. It is use widely throuhgout the island and it is the main language used to communicate. With me being in High school i have taken 6 years of the Spanish language throughout my lifetime so it was essentally an easy language for me. It was easy for me to understand and interpret the people to help guide my family during our vacation. The spanish language itself is so beautiful and is known to be one of the top romance language. Learning new and different languages was always an interest for me and during this vacation I had an opportunity to better develop and learn more of the Spanish language,their is alway beauty to a language that many cannot gasp the concept of, the spanish language although a very common language has been adjusted and adapted in many ways for example if you went to spain they have different ways of saying certain things and they have adapted their own slang to better fit the poeple likewise in DR although the main language is spanish they have better adapted the languag to fit the people.</p>

<h2>The People<h2>
<p> The people of whom i have met during my visit were very unique and different. They were full of energy and laugther and made the place so festive and bright, i enjoyed the aura they gave off. The people that i had met made my experience so friendly and wonderful. During my stay the locals were very inviting and often tried to teach me phrases or slang to better understand the language. I have truly never met a bunch of people whom were so hositile and comfortable yet so proud of showing their culture and their country. These are the type of people you normally dont see often, these people take pride in their music,their food, their country they show tremendous nationality towards their country. Not only are they proud but being that the DR is an undeveloped country with lack of tap water and limited resoruces the locals are very hard working and determined. We often overlook how diligent these locals, they work mulitple hours with little pay yet to me personally they work the hardest they can to feed themseleves and their family. To me these people are simply an inspiration with how determined and diligent they are and how their characters are simply unique and distinct </p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<p> Music plays a big role in the culture of the Dominican Republic, for the people music is a way to enjoy life and let go. Being that the DR itself is a undeveloped country music acts as a getaway to the people and they thrive off the rhythms and the flow of the fresh music. During my stay i was introduced to alot of the traditional music of the country, the traditional music tend to reflect on the people and the way of their lives as if they were protraying a story through song. One of the most traditional yet well known music in the DR is the Merengue. Merengue originated from the Domincian republic, the people use this type of music and dance as a way to conserve their culture and tradition, in my visit the locals taught me a few steps of the Merengue it is a dance that requires a lot of foot work and hip movement 
while i stumbled a lot it was entertaining to learn the dance and embrace the culture.</p>

<h2>Food<h2>
<p> In the Domincian Rebulic the food is very mixed with different cultures, it takes some dishes from african culture, from taino culutre and from the spanish culutre. During my visit they had a variety of the best serving food. Since the type of food i normally eat is curry and indian type dishes the food served in the DR was a brand new experince for me. The dishes were simply beyond describable, everyday they served us different traditional foods from plantians to beans and rice to different type of meats or seafood. The typical dominican dishes were simple,healthy  and contained alot of natural ingredients like rice,beans,bananas,fruits,etc. I enjoyed the fact that the food i was eating was all natural and not processed and that it was all well cooked. The food was one of my favorite part of the trip becuase of the many variety of dishes to choose from. I enjoyed experinecing the different types of food that DR had to offer.</p>

<h2> Nature/ tourist sites<h2>
<p>As well known The Dominican Rebulic is a very well known tourist location filled with beautiful beaches,sites,natured filled enivroments that attract millions world wide from all over the globe. There is a reason for this full blown reputation or DR lives up to its name, the sites are absolutely stunning and the nature is so pure and untouched. I adored the pureness of it all and how attracting it all was, I now fully understand why it maintains it reputation. The sites i saw and experienced where unlike any other it is still hard to believe how naturally beautiful the views were and how untouched and well kept they were. I highly recommend visiting the DR at least one in your lifetime to get a hold of the breathtaking views they have to offer.</p>
